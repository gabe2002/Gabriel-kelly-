  <h2>Fresno California</h2>
  <p>I have been attending Edison High School for almost a year now.
  Even though I've never thought I would attend this school it's not that bad of a school. </p>
  <p>I happen to not play any sports but I'm really in to them.</p>
<p>I only have two sister's and there both really nice to me.</p>
